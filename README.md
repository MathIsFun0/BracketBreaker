# BracketBreaker (WIP)
A program that automatically fills in billions of March Madness tournament brackets in order to potentially generate a coveted "perfect bracket" that correctly predicts all 63 tournament matches (besides the First Four).

Planned Features:
* Lots of customization - allowing for use in pretty much any tournament
* Use of sigmoid function for tournament ratings
* Automatic generation and storage of filled-out tournament brackets
* Verification and statistics of tournament brackets that remain correct for a certain number of games
